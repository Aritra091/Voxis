🚀 VOXIS – The Multilingual AI Assistant
An intelligent assistant that understands and responds to text, voice, and images in multiple languages, powered by Groq for ultra-low-latency AI inference.

📌 Problem Statement
Problem Statement 1 – Build a multilingual AI assistant using Groq that understands and responds via text, audio, and image inputs.

🎯 Objective
VOXIS solves the problem of fragmented communication interfaces by unifying multimodal inputs—text, audio, and image—into one intelligent assistant.
Whether you're a student, professional, or visually/hearing impaired, VOXIS offers accessible and context-aware assistance, powered by blazing-fast inference from Groq.
Its goal is to bridge digital and human communication across languages and formats, making smart assistance truly inclusive.
